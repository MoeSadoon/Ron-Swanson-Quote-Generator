## Synopsis

A Ron Swanson Quote generator that uses AJAX requests to generate a random quote from the great man himself.

It makes a request using four different means:
- XMLHTTPRequest
- Fetch API
- jQuery AJAX
- Axios library

## Code Example

To have a play, simply clone the repo and open the index.html file.

## Motivation

To practice AJAX requests, and because I love Parks and Recreation.
